[This Program is to test the fundamentals of java programing]
Tasks within the program:
# the fundamentals for the program on the VSC (Visual Studio Code) section at the top of the webpage this allows the user to veiw the code and conduct testing and debuging

[!INFORMATION]
the commonts on the program explain the sections as well as the commonts having sections (they are either made up of '===', '---' or '___') this is done to help the user to understand where some of the functions start / stop without needing to look to hard within the 'public static void'.

## What the parts of the program does and what may happen if the values are changed
[!NOTE]
**changing the values within the program will change the outcome of the program to a different one**

*** -- Variable decleration -- ***
this allows the program to be tested with multiple different types data without there needing to be a HTML link

*** -- GreaterEqualLess -- ***
this area checks the input of 'num1' and 'num2' to check which value is or smaller than / equal to
/ greater than then outputs the result to the user

*** -- PositiveNegativeZero -- ***
this area check the input of 'num1' and 'num2' and will see if they are negative / positive or Zero within the values they are given

*** -- Calc -- ***
this area is used to preform the mathmatical calculations this is done by 
[!NOTE]
~~ changing the 'mode' within the program changes the type of calculation that will be preformed along with the output
~~ changing the values (num1 and num2) will change the expected outcome as well as the selection to be different due to the different values

*** -- Loops -- ***

***-- for loop --***
this area is where a variable (i) is used to conduct a for loop this causes the repertation of the loop for the set amount of times which are 10.
this causes the program to print 'Iteration number: 1' while also repeating this until it gets to 'Iteration number: 10'.
[!NOTE]
this program for the 'for loop' does work even though the 'while loop' doesn't

***-- while loop --***
[!EXPECTED]
~~ the while program is appost to loop 10 times while printing 'While Loop Iteration: [number]' to the display for the user to view within the terminal of the program (due to it being Java)

[!NOTE]
-- i got the while loop working and have changed it within here

<-- IGNORE THE LINES BELOW -->
[!IMPORTANT]
~~ the 'while' loop doesn't work due to an error with the conditioning of the loop.
~~ the error that has occoured i can not fix due to lack of knowledge as well as unclear solutions methods.
